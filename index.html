                I participated in several workshops through the year which covered important concepts in manufacturing and robotics. I learned how to use various types of 3D printers as well as their mechanisms and I mastered programming microcontrollers using the Arduino IDE. 
<br><br>
We participated in the ASME EFx Innovative Additive Manufacturing 3D Challenge wherein I was the Head of the Electronics team. We leveraged Solidworks CAD, Arduino, and Prusa MK3S+ and Ender 3 V2 printers to build a hovercraft, remotely controlled by a joystick, capable of navigating a maze and delivering a payload. I directed the electronics team through each aspect of the hovercraft’s wiring, programming and remote communication.

I was part of the drone team where in I worked on two drones. The first was a speed drone being designed to break the Guinness World Record of the fastest drone which flew at 172kmph. Work on this drone is in progress and will be completed soon. I also worked on an autonomous delivery drone which could be used to deliver a payload. Through this I enhanced my skills in Computer Vision, Robotics, Aerodynamics and Programming.

                The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a is an annual international event, founded by Dean Kamen in 1989, that challenges high school students to collaborate and build robots to compete in dynamic games. <br><br>
                I designed a robot capable of intake and shooting of balls at a desired target. It had these capabilities while being 
                controlled both by a joystick and autonomously. This provided me great exposure to Robot Programming and Computer Vision<br><br>
                I was the head of my team's programming division and was responsible for coding and electronics of the robot, and logistics such as team meetings and strategy discussions. <br><br>
                FRC embedded in me the principles of teamwork, dedication, problem-solving and gracious proffesionalism. Due to the pandemic,
                we faced issues with customs while importing parts which set us behind on the timeline. Eventually, I was able to motivate my team to strive towards
                our goal and build our robot in 4 months as opposed to the 1 year that all teams spent. <br><br>
                We were awarded Runner's Up in the Qualcomm Innovation Challenge for designing an app to aid the elderly in healthcare matters 
                and help build a community of like-minded and like-aged individuals who otherwise found themselves lonely and in need
                of a support system. <br><br>
                A strong advocate of STEM, I organized numerous workshops for young students and underpriviliged children to encourage them 
                to pursue STEM by stimulating their interest in robotics. At a school for the less fortunate, I conducted workshops to 
                train students in basic skills, and then helped them establish a team to participate in the FIRST Tech Challenge.
